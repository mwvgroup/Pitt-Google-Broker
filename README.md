# Pitt-Google Alert Broker

The Pitt-Google broker is an astronomical alert broker that is being developed for large
scale surveys of the night sky, particularly the upcoming
[Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time](https://www.lsst.org/)
(LSST). We currently process and serve the
[Zwicky Transient Facility](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/)'s (ZTF) nightly alert stream.
The broker runs on the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) (GCP).

Documentation is at [pitt-broker.readthedocs.io](https://pitt-broker.readthedocs.io/).

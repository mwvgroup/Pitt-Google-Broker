# Pitt-Google Alert Broker

The Pitt-Google broker is an astronomical alert broker that is being developed for large scale surveys of the night sky, particularly the upcoming [Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time](https://www.lsst.org/) (LSST).
We currently process and serve the [Zwicky Transient Facility](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/)'s (ZTF) nightly alert stream.
The broker runs on the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) (GCP).

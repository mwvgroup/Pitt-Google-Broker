# LSST Science Book
"LSST will enable early detection of prototype cases for a number of
theoretically predicted explosive transients which we’ve already discussed, including orphan GRB
afterglows, accretion induced collapse events, fall-back and pair-instability supernovae, and the so
called SN 0.Ia." pg 267

"AM CVn binaries are extremely rare relatives of cataclysmic variables with ultra-short orbital
periods; the most extreme cases have orbital periods of tens of minutes, arguably encompassing
the shortest orbital periods of any known class of binaries" pg 288

LBVs pg 296

"LSST will also address the issue
of the eruptive variability found in a rare class of young stellar objects - the FUor and EXor stars.
FUor and EXor variables are named after the prototypes FU Orionis (Hartmann & Kenyon 1996)
and EX Lupi (Herbig et al. 2001) respectively. These stars exhibit outburst behavior characterized
by an up to 6 magnitude increase in optical brightness, with high states persisting from several years
to many decades. Both classes of objects are interpreted as pre-main sequence stars undergoing
significantly increased mass accretion rate possibly due to instabilities in the circumstellar accretion
disk." pg 298

" PTF will discover hundreds of supernovae and possibly several rare events such
as “0.Ia”, Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) and Macronovae (MNe) per year. The LSST (Deep Wide Fast Survey) will
discover hundreds of rare events in the Local Universe." pg 255

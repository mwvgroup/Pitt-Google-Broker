# Setup Google Cloud

1. Setup and configure a new Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project.
    - [Instructions in our current docs](https://pitt-broker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_setup/installation.html). We would need to follow pieces of the "Installation" and "Defining Environmental Variables" sections. Our project is already setup, so leaving out most of the details for now.

2. Install GCP tools on your machine:
    - [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install): Follow the instructions at the link. (This installs `gcloud`, `gsutil` and `bq` command line tools). I use a minimum version of Google Cloud SDK 323.0.0.
    - [Cloud Client Libraries for Python](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference): Each service requires a different library; the ones we need are (I hope) all listed in the `requirements.txt` in this directory. Install them with (e.g., ) `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

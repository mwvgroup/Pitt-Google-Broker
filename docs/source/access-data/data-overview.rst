Data Overview
=============

Pub/Sub
----------------

Pub/Sub is an asynchronous, publishâ€“subscribe messaging service.
The Pitt-Google broker publishes alerts and value-added data to multiple topics,
listed below.
You can subscribe to one or more of these topics,
and then pull and process the message stream(s).
See the :doc:`tutorials/pubsub` tutorial for more information.

Current streams include:

ztf-loop

    Use this stream for testing. Recent ZTF alerts are published to this topic
    at a constant rate of 1 per second, day and night.

# Dependencies needed to develop and deploy the broker.

# I (Troy) suggest we direct people to install `pgb-utils` rather than offering
# this separate requirements file. `pgb-utils` is currently optimized for a
# Colab install which has several unique requirements, so creating this file
# first to collect/check what is needed.

# ZTF_DMAM_V19_NoC_SNIa_vs_CC_forFink

This directory contains a trained [SuperNNova](https://github.com/supernnova/SuperNNova) model (vanilla_S_0_CLF_2_R_none_photometry_DF_1.0_N_global_lstm_32x2_0.05_128_True_mean.pt) and related output/log files.
The model was kindly provided to us by Anais Möller.
It was trained on "ZTF sims from the old cadence" (Oct 21, 2021).
Classification performance could benefit from retraining with better data.
Class0 is the SN Ia probability score.

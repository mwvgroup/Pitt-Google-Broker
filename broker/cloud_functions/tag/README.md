# Purity Filter

Adapted from: https://zwickytransientfacility.github.io/ztf-avro-alert/filtering.html

Quoted from the source:

ZTF alert streams contain an nearly entirely unfiltered stream of all
5-sigma (only the most obvious artefacts are rejected). Depending on your
science case, you may wish to improve the purity of your sample by filtering
the data on the included attributes.
Based on tests done at IPAC (F. Masci, priv. comm), the following filter
delivers a relatively pure sample.
